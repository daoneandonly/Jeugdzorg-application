 # Jeugdzorg application

The following application is made as an assignment for the 'Frontend application' at the University of Applied Sciences of Amsterdam. This is my first application with use of the React framework.


install:

```bash
npm install
```

Start:

```bash
npm start
```

The application uses ``data.json`` to load in the questions, categories and answers.

The most upright icon lets the use switch between clients and add a new one.
